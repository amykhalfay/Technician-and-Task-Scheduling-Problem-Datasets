Technician and Task Scheduling Problem Datasets

The datasets stored have bene creating as part of my Phd research. There are 3 sets of data; large scale, precedence constrained and routing. 

Large Scale Data - 12 data instances scheduling between 1000-2500 jobs. Created under the framework of the ROADEF 2007 challenge, therefore include scheduling over multiple days, building teams, priority levels, precedence constraints, priority levels and skill constraints. 

Precedence Constrained Data - 25 data instances scheduling betweeen 100-1000 jobs. Created under the framework of the ROADEF 2007 challenge, therefore include scheduling over multiple days, building teams, priority levels, precedence constraints, priority levels and skill constraints. The datasets range between including 0-100% precedence constraints. 

Routing data  -  30 instances created by extending the ROADEF 2007 datasets by generating locations for each customer. These datasets do not include precedence relationships but do include all other constraints present in the original datasets.
